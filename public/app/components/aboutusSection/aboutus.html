          <p>Novowash adopts advanced steam technologies to not just clean but sanitize interiors. When a steam cleaner is used,
            the tiny hot vapor molecules penetrate the pores of a surface, and as they come in contact with the cool surface
            of the pores, they expand and force all dirt, debris, and bacteria to the surface. Vapor molecules are so hot
            that they are not only able to extract pathogens like E. Coli and Salmonella from surface pores, but also kill
            them. Good-bye infectious enemies!</p>
